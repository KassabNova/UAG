    "    The very first thing the slides explain is the len() function, that returns a string length. And then something that I liked about python: negative indexing!<br>\n",
    "    It's possible to use a negative index inside a string's brackets to go in 'reverse'. What I mean by that is that string[-1] will evaluate to the last char and string[-2] will evaluate to the last char -1.<br>\n",
    "    The string slicing is made with the [start:stop:step], where the default start will be 0, the stop will be the string's length, and the step will be 1.\n",
    "    A VERY VERY IMPORTANT thing in strings, when manipulating them, is that they are immutable and can't be modified.<br>\n",
    "    Strings and loops go hand by hand, and as seen in the example below, you can nest iterations through more than one string.\n",
