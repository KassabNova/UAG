Luckily, I'm used to good programming practices and I indent my code, but the thing in python is that it *FORCES* the programmer to indent. Python uses de indentation to identify the blocks of code, and if something is outside it's supposed block it *WON'T RUN* or it will have unexpected behaviour. \n",
